LIFO(last in First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out).\n","\n","Queue − It is similar to Stack but the order of operation is only FIFO(First In First Out).\n","\n","Matrix − It is two dimensional data structure in which the data element is referred by a pair of indices.\n","\n","\n","\n","Non-Linear Data Structures\n","\n","Binary Tree − It is a data structure where each data element can be connected to maximum two other data elements and it starts with a root node.\n","\n","Heap − It is a special case of Tree data structure where the data in the parent node is either strictly greater than/ equal to the child nodes or strictly less than it’s child nodes.\n","\n","Hash Table − It is a data structure which is made of arrays associated with each other using a hash function. It retrieves values using keys rather than index from a data element.\n","\n","Graph − It is an arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.\n","\n","\n","\n","Python Specific Data Structures\n","\n","List − It is similar to array with the exception that the data elements can be of different data types. You can have both numeric and string data in a python list.\n","\n","Tuple − Tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable which means the values in a tuple cannot be modified they can only be read.\n","\n","Dictionary − The dictionary contains Key-value pairs as its data elements.\n","\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]\n","list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]\n","list3 = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]"],"metadata":{"id":"9idbUAj1jGLf"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# LISTS\n","# Accessing items\n","\n","list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]\n","list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]\n","print(\"list1[0]: \", list1[0])        # prints physics\n","print(\"list2[1:5]: \", list2[1:5])    # prints [2,3,4,5]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4-NuBeqejPuZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1656105035229,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":426,"user":{"displayName":"gokhan bektas","userId":"12045741795015469054"}},"outputId":"e89b5f1f-e7f0-4e0f-a1ae-d81fdf637560"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["list1[0]:  physics\n","list2[1:5]:  [2, 3, 4, 5]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"Cij3oy6Bj_XP"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# LISTS\n","# Update an item\n","list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]\n","print(\"Value available at index 2 : \")\n","print(list[2])           # prints 1997\n","list[2] = 2001\n","print(\"New value available at index 2 : \")\n","print(list[2])           # prints 2001"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VwaRv-eUjp0H","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1656105141469,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":264,"user":{"displayName":"gokhan bektas","userId":"12045741795015469054"}},"outputId":"aedc8f7c-7987-4844-b5a8-32be2f6b6bb0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Value available at index 2 : \n","1997\n","New value available at index 2 : \n","2001\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","Python Expression\tResults\tDescription\n","len([1, 2, 3])\t              3\t                            Length\n","[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]\t        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\t          Concatenation\n","['Hi!'] * 4\t                  ['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']\tRepetition\n","3 in [1, 2, 3]\t              True\t                        Membership\n","for x in [1, 2, 3]: print x,\t1 2 3\t                        Iteration\n","\"\"\""],"metadata":{"id":"iQaZOKKMkXQ-"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# LISTS\n","# Delete an item\n","\n","list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]\n","print(list1)\n","del list1[2]\n","print(\"After deleting value at index 2 : \")\n","print(list1)    # prints  ['physics','chemistry',2000]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"i36U2YQfkDKk","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1656105276622,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":265,"user":{"displayName":"gokhan bektas","userId":"12045741795015469054"}},"outputId":"d3478ced-7b68-4818-db46-f62144eb1fcb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]\n","After deleting value at index 2 : \n","['physics', 'chemistry', 2000]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["thislist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","thislist.append(\"orange\")\n","print(thislist)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"whAdHrqiM1LK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1656266940635,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"gokhan bektas","userId":"12045741795015469054"}},"outputId":"a6e1e337-5470-462b-918c-e13f0ffdea2e"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']\n"]}]}]}
